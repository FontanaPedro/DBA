Preguntas LAB 4: 


When I create the units for hidden layers of Multy-Layers Percertron Neural Network model (MLP), do I need to zip them? 
--> No, because Zip will consume too much CPU power

For this Data sets, should I use regressors or classifiers? --> classifier = te da una probabilidad junto con la clase que te define. 
                                                            --> regressors = te da un exacta clase pero sin ningÃºna probabilidad por atras. 

Can I save the 2 different splits with different amount of features in a variable? 
--> No, I need to re split the model, important to do the random state for that




Functions to do in order to save them in a doc: 

- Graph different scores
- Classifier regions 
- Graph comparing different scores w/ different regularization coefficients 



QUESTIONS FOR DANIEL LAB 4:

1. When to use Regressors and classifiers in LAB 4? Is it only depending on the classes? 

2. When I compare models, what should I consider appart from the score? 

3. How do I improve the model if the regulariation coefficient is not helping? 




QUESTIONS TO ANSWER WHILE DOING THE LABS:

- Which output I am looking for? 

- Is it a regression or classification problem? Whay would be the difference of applying both for the same problem? 

- Trainins accuracy is equal =1 ? difference between the accuracy scores 

- Is there over or underfitting? why? 

- How can I improve the model? 

- Compare different models
